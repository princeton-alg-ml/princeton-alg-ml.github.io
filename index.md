Welcome to the Princeton Alg-ML Seminar Page! 

Alg-ML is a weekly ML theory seminar primarily attended by the research groups of Prof. Sanjeev Arora, Prof. Elad Hazan, Prof. Jason Lee, and Prof. Chi Jin. 
We discuss exciting recent advancements in the areas of algorithm design and theoretical machine learning. 

Talks are held **every Monday from 12:15 pm ET to 1:15 pm ET**, with food usually served at 12:00 pm ET. It is open to all members of the Princeton community. 

For the 2023-2024 academic year, this seminar is organized by[^1]:

> The study of population dynamics has evolved from early sociological studies  ~\cite{malthus1872essay}, extending into various fields including biology, epidemiology,  evolutionary game theory, and economics. These studies have predominantly focused on population growth and compositionality rather than control. Existing mathematical models for population control are often restricted to specific, noise-free dynamics, while real-world population changes can be complex and adversarial.
To address this gap, we propose a new framework based on the paradigm of online control. We first characterize a set of marginally stable linear dynamical systems that can be controlled even in the presence of adversarial perturbation. We then give an efficient gradient-based method with optimal regret bounds vs. the optimal linear policy for these systems.  Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in population control models such as SIR and replicator dynamics.
