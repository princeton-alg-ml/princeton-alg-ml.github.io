Welcome to the Princeton Alg-ML Seminar Page! 

Alg-ML is a weekly ML theory seminar primarily attended by the research groups of Prof. Sanjeev Arora, Prof. Elad Hazan, Prof. Jason Lee, and Prof. Chi Jin. 
We discuss exciting recent advancements in the areas of algorithm design and theoretical machine learning. 

Talks are held **every Monday from 12:30 pm ET to 1:30 pm ET**, with food usually served at 12:15 pm ET. It is open to all members of the Princeton community. 

For the 2023-2024 academic year, this seminar is organized by[^1]:

> **Reward-agnostic Fine-tuning: Provable Statistical Benefits of Hybrid Reinforcement Learning**
>
> This paper studies tabular reinforcement learning (RL) in the hybrid setting, which assumes access to both an offline dataset and online interactions with the unknown environment. A central question boils down to how to efficiently utilize online data collection to strengthen and complement the offline dataset and enable effective policy fine-tuning. Leveraging recent advances in reward-agnostic exploration and model-based offline RL, we design a three-stage hybrid RL algorithm that beats the best of both worlds -- pure offline RL and pure online RL -- in terms of sample complexities. The proposed algorithm does not require any reward information during data collection. Our theory is developed based on a new notion called single-policy partial concentrability, which captures the trade-off between distribution mismatch and miscoverage and guides the interplay between offline and online data.
