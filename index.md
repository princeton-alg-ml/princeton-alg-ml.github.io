Welcome to the Princeton Alg-ML Seminar Page! 

Alg-ML is a weekly ML theory seminar primarily attended by the research groups of Prof. Sanjeev Arora, Prof. Elad Hazan, Prof. Jason Lee, and Prof. Chi Jin. 
We discuss exciting recent advancements in the areas of algorithm design and theoretical machine learning. 

Talks are held **every Monday from 12:15 pm ET to 1:15 pm ET**, with food usually served at 12:00 pm ET. It is open to all members of the Princeton community. 

For the 2023-2024 academic year, this seminar is organized by[^1]:

> **The Neural Covariance SDE and Its Limiting Spectrum **
>
> Recent advances in neural network research have predominantly focused on infinite-width architectures, yet the complexities inherent in modelling networks with substantial depth call for a novel theoretical framework. In this presentation, we explore a unique approach to modelling neural networks using the proportional infinite-depth-and-width limit.
>In fact, naively stacking non-linearities in deep networks leads to problematic degenerate behaviour at initialization. To address this challenge and achieve a well-behaved infinite-depth limit, we introduce a fundamentally novel framework: we treat neural networks as depthwise stochastic processes. Within this framework, the limit is characterized by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that governs the feature covariance matrix. Notably, the framework we introduced leads to a very accurate model of finite size networks, and the approach yields a natural remedy for vanishing gradients in Transformers. Finally, we will also leverage the SDE structure to derive a limit spectrum result for feature covariance of linear networks.
