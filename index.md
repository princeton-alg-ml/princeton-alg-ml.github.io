Welcome to the Princeton Alg-ML Seminar Page! 

Alg-ML is a weekly ML theory seminar primarily attended by the research groups of Prof. Sanjeev Arora, Prof. Elad Hazan, Prof. Jason Lee, and Prof. Chi Jin. 
We discuss exciting recent advancements in the areas of algorithm design and theoretical machine learning. 

Talks are held **every Monday from 12:15 pm ET to 1:15 pm ET**, with food usually served at 12:00 pm ET. It is open to all members of the Princeton community. 

For the 2023-2024 academic year, this seminar is organized by[^1]:

> This paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range dependencies. We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model.
Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice.The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.
