Welcome to the Princeton Alg-ML Seminar Page! 

Alg-ML is a weekly ML theory seminar primarily attended by the research groups of Prof. Sanjeev Arora, Prof. Elad Hazan, Prof. Jason Lee, and Prof. Chi Jin. 
We discuss exciting recent advancements in the areas of algorithm design and theoretical machine learning. 

Talks are held **every Monday from 12:15 pm ET to 1:15 pm ET**, with food usually served at 12:00 pm ET. It is open to all members of the Princeton community. 

For the 2023-2024 academic year, this seminar is organized by[^1]:

# This week's talk
## February 5, 2024 | Computer Science 302

> **Qinghua Liu**

> **Foundations of Sequential Decision Making**
>
> Pattern recognition, such as computer vision, studies the passive perception of the world, while decision-making, represented by reinforcement learning, centers on active interaction with the world through purposeful actions. This talk will provide an overview of my research in establishing the foundations of sequential decision-making. In the first part, I will talk about reinforcement learning with function approximation, a widely adopted approach for tackling real-world decision-making problems characterized by enormous state spaces. I will demonstrate that the classical Fitted Q-iteration algorithm (the prototype of modern DQN) can be made provably sample-efficient with slight modifications, rendering it effective in solving a diverse array of decision-making problems. Moving to the second part, I will focus on partially observable decision-making. Despite long-standing beliefs within the theory community that it is intractable, supported by numerous hardness results, I will unveil a rich class of partially observable decision-making problems of practical interests, which can be solved within polynomial samples through a variant of the classical maximum likelihood estimation algorithm. Finally, I will turn to multi-agent decision-making, where the learner must strategically cooperate or compete with other decision-makers. I will introduce a fully decentralized algorithm capable of learning equilibria (non-exploitable) strategies in multi-agent decision-making with nearly minimax-optimal sample efficiency.
